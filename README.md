# Owlet - can you think of a better name?

Owlet is a website to promote the idea of using orphaned oil wells for compressed air energy storage.

## Dependencies
To run the website you will need: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Instructions
clone this repository,
in terminal type:
`npm start` and hit enter.
npm should serve the website on your machine at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## TODO
1. Make the webshite look better.
2. Scrape the [orphan wells association](http://www.orphanwell.ca/about/orphan-inventory/) to update the map of orphaned wells.
3. Scrape the [Alberta energy use](http://ets.aeso.ca/ets_web/ip/Market/Reports/CSDReportServlet) and calculate the supply / demand to show whether the wells would be charging or discharging.
4. Track the charge / discharge over the previous 24 hours, or week, and chart it.
